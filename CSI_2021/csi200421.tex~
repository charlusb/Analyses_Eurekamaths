        \section{Introduction}

        \begin{frame}

        
          
        How do we learn new mathematical concepts ?

        \end{frame}


        \begin{frame}

          Studying the change of paradigm in geometry, from euclidean geometry to a more general geometry, using a fundamental concept : straight line


        \end{frame}

        \begin{frame}
                    Why non euclidean geometry ?

          For almost 2000 years, euclidean geometry was considered as the most natural geometry

          
          \footnotesize{spelke}

          \normalsize{Contre intuitive}
          
          Tardive in the history of humanity
          
          Some of its models are not representable with our space intuitions

          Emerged in a formal way, from a failed attempt to prove its contradiction
          
          Some of its models contradicts basic postulates of euclidean geometry, notably the fact that there always exist a parallel line to another one


          Fundamental notion of euclidean goemetry : intuitive on the plane, not primitive but hard to define

        \end{frame}


                \begin{frame}

          Euclidean geometry is historically considered as the most easy to conceive for humans (Spelke, Lee and Izard 2010 )

          Is it the case for a fundamental concept such as straight line ? Does it reflects the euclidean intuitions?

        \end{frame}
        \begin{frame}


          Straight line: a fundamental concept of euclidean geometry. Non primitive, used as a basic concept for more complex definitions, and hard to define without circularity

          Euclid's definition : \textit{A line is a length without width, and a straight line is a line equally placed between its points}

         \end{frame}

        

        \begin{frame}

          Generalization of straight line to curved surfaces: geodesic. Trajectory

          \hfill
          
          \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}



                  &   Straight line   & Geodesic  \\

            \hline

             Planar              &  X  &      \\

             Infinite            &  X  &      \\


          \end{tabular}
          

        \end{frame}
        

        \begin{frame}


        \end{frame}




        \begin{frame}

          Studying the generalization of straight line on curved surfaces

          Properties of geodesic not possess all the same properties as planar straight lines: in particular, a straight trajectory may intersect itself, and more importantly it does not necessarily correspond to a planar intersection.

        \end{frame}


        \section{Plan of the thesis}
        
        \begin{frame}
          
          Is the intuition about the straight line really euclidean ? If it is, is it possible to change your initial intuition, or do you just learn heuristics and methods
          to answer correctly to specific problems? 
          
          Dynamic of learning and metacognition :
          Is there a specific metacognitive signature associated to new situation of learning ? 
          

          Do participants really learn something new ?

          \item{In learning situation, do this conceptual change come along with typical metacognitive signature? (One article submitted, an online replication planned)}

          giving a definition which gives the essential property of geodesic whoch coincides with straight line, how do they manage to identify straigth lines on curved surfaces ?

          Two questions : 


          \begin{itemize}

          \item{When put in formal context, do participants reproduce this bias ? : Math educated participants (five years or more of formal education in maths, able to understand the exact definition of geodesic)}

           

          \item{Does the new concept collapses the former intuition or is there still traces of the planar heuristic ? Differential geometry experts (PhD or more in differential geometry or connex fields)}
